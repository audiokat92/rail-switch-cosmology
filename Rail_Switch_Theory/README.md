## **DISCOVERY SUMMARY**
* **The Problem:** Standard Big Bang theory predicts a "Singularity" (Infinite Density), which breaks the laws of physics.
* **The Solution:** We apply **Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble (ECSK)** gravity, which adds **Spin** to spacetime.
* **The Mechanism:** As the universe collapses, the spin of quantum particles creates a repulsive "Torsion" force that scales as $a^{-6}$. This acts as a "Rail-Switch," diverting the collapse into a **Big Bounce**.
* **The Evidence:** The theory predicts a "Left-Handed" universe. 2023 Galaxy Parity data confirms this asymmetry.

## 🛠️ The Math (Simplified)
The bounce is driven by the interaction term in the Dirac Equation:
$$i \gamma^\mu \nabla_\mu \psi - m\psi = -\frac{3 \pi G \hbar^2}{4 c^2} (\bar{\psi} \gamma_5 \gamma_\mu \psi)^2$$

This creates a repulsive potential that prevents the radius $a(t)$ from ever reaching zero.
